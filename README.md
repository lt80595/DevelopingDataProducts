### About Shiny Application:

The purpose of my Shiny App, see http://lt8o595.shinyapps.io/CourseProject/, was to hopefully teach some items of Middle Eastern Geography in an interactive manner.  Having lived in various countries around the world and interacted with people of many cultures, I believe that people should occasionally brush up on their geography in order to understand where individuals are coming from, culturally and geographically.
